                        <p className='paragraph-about-myself'>I am a self- motivated full stack software developer with an eagerness to learn! I am coming from a background in Elementary Education and while I loved teaching my students, I was quickly overcome by feelings of stagnation and eagerness to be in a position where I could constantly grow and learn. 
                        I then decided to put my efforts into a new career path and began learning HTML and CSS through Udemy. I started to dive into JavaScript but after I had learned the basics, I realized I needed the help of a structured environment to help me reach the next level and thats when I applied for the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy!
                        In my new career path, I am looking forward to building really interesting and useful projects! I am now in a field where I will be a forever learner so Iâ€™m excited to see my growth and progress as I continue forward.
